This project explores the predictors of divorce using a simulated dataset of 5,000 observations. The main goal is to assess whether internal relationship factors (e.g., communication, infidelity, trust) or structural factors (e.g., age at marriage, education, income) are stronger predictors of divorce.
The analysis includes:
- Descriptive statistics of internal and structural variables
- Multiple logistic regression models for internal, structural, and combined factors
- Interpretation of significant predictors and model performance
- Interactive Shiny dashboard for exploring predicted probabilities of divorce based on user-defined profiles
This project provides insights into the role of individual agency versus structural constraints in influencing divorce outcomes.
